          DBMS TERMINOLOGIES
        </h1>
         <div>
            <p class="Title">Data</p>
            <p class="para"> Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures that lack context. Examples of data include numerical values, characters, dates, and symbols that, on their own, may not convey much meaning.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Information</p>
            <p class="para">Information is data that has been processed, organized, or structured in a way that provides context and meaning. This processed data is useful for decision-making as it conveys the significance of the raw data.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Metadata</p>
            <p class="para"> Metadata is data that provides information about other data, detailing aspects like the source, format, structure, and context. Metadata helps users understand and utilize the primary data effectively by describing its characteristics and relationships.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Data Dictionary</p>
            <p class="para">A data dictionary is a centralized repository containing definitions and descriptions of the data and its elements within a database. It includes details such as data types, relationships between data, and constraints, which help ensure consistency and clarity in the database.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Database</p>
            <p class="para">A database is an organized collection of structured data, generally stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are designed to manage, retrieve, and update data efficiently and are managed by database management systems (DBMS), which provide tools for handling large amounts of information.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Table</p>
            <p class="para">A table is a collection of related data entries organized in rows and columns within a database. Each table represents a specific type of data and consists of multiple records (rows), each containing fields (columns) with data values.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Tuple</p>
            <p class="para">A tuple is a single row in a table, representing a single record within a database. It contains data for each field defined in the table structure, providing a complete set of data for that particular entry.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Field</p>
            <p class="para"> A field is a single piece of data within a record, representing a specific attribute or property of the data being stored. Fields are the columns in a database table, each designed to hold a specific type of data, such as text, numbers, or dates.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Domain</p>
            <p class="para"> A domain is the set of all possible values that a particular field can have. Domains define the permissible data that can be stored in a field, ensuring data integrity and consistency by restricting input to valid values.</p><br>

            <p class="title">Constraint</p>
            <p class="para"> A constraint is a rule or restriction applied to a database field or table to enforce data integrity. Constraints ensure that the data entered into the database meets certain criteria, such as uniqueness, non-null values, or specific ranges.  </p><br>

            <p class="title">Key</p>
            <p class="para"> A key is a field or set of fields in a table that is used to identify records uniquely. Keys are crucial for establishing and maintaining relationships between tables and ensuring that each record can be precisely accessed.</p><br>
